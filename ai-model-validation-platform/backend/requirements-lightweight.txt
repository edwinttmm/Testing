# Core image processing - lightweight alternatives
pillow>=10.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
imageio>=2.31.0  # Lightweight image I/O
scikit-image>=0.21.0  # Lightweight image processing

# Machine Learning - lightweight alternatives  
scikit-learn>=1.3.0  # Traditional ML, much smaller than PyTorch
joblib>=1.3.0  # Parallel processing for sklearn

# Computer Vision - lightweight
matplotlib>=3.7.0  # Basic plotting and image display
