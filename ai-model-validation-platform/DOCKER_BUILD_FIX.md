# Docker Build Fix - Resolution Summary

## Problem Identified
The Docker build was failing with the error:
```
COPY failed: file not found in build context or excluded by .dockerignore: stat scripts/wait-for-services.sh: file does not exist
```

## Root Cause
The Dockerfile at `backend/Dockerfile` was trying to copy `scripts/wait-for-services.sh` from its build context. However:
1. The build context is set to `./backend` directory in docker-compose.yml
2. The script existed in `ai-model-validation-platform/scripts/` but not in `backend/scripts/`
3. Docker can only access files within the build context directory

## Solution Applied
Created the required script in the correct location:
1. Created directory: `backend/scripts/`
2. Copied `wait-for-services.sh` from parent scripts directory to `backend/scripts/`
3. Made the script executable with proper permissions

## Files Modified/Created
- Created: `/ai-model-validation-platform/backend/scripts/wait-for-services.sh`

## Deployment Instructions

### For Local Testing
```bash
cd /home/user/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### For Remote Deployment (Vultr)
1. **Transfer the fixed files to your Vultr server:**
```bash
# From your local machine
scp -r ai-model-validation-platform/backend/scripts/ root@155.138.239.131:~/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/backend/
```

2. **On the Vultr server, rebuild and restart:**
```bash
ssh root@155.138.239.131
cd ~/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up --build -d
```

3. **Verify services are running:**
```bash
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs backend
```

## Verification Steps
1. Check if all containers are running:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

2. Test backend health endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```

3. Check logs for any errors:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f backend
   ```

## Additional Notes
- The `wait-for-services.sh` script ensures that PostgreSQL and Redis are ready before the backend starts
- It includes proper timeout handling and service verification
- The script supports multiple connection testing methods (nc, telnet, bash tcp)

## Potential Issues When Moving Systems
When downloading and deploying on different systems, ensure:
1. All required files are transferred (especially the scripts directory)
2. File permissions are preserved (scripts should be executable)
3. Line endings are correct (LF for Linux, not CRLF from Windows)
4. Environment variables are properly set in `.env` file

## Quick Fix Command
If the issue persists on the Vultr server, run this one-liner:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/backend/scripts && \
cp ~/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/scripts/wait-for-services.sh ~/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/backend/scripts/ && \
chmod +x ~/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/backend/scripts/wait-for-services.sh
```

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - The missing script has been created in the correct location. Docker build should now complete successfully.
