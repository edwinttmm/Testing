# YOLOv8 Pedestrian Detection Fixes

## Problem Analysis

The YOLOv8 model was processing 121 frames but finding "0 valid detections" for pedestrians, including a visible child in the video. The issues identified were:

### Root Causes
1. **Too high confidence threshold** (0.70) filtering out valid pedestrian detections
2. **Frame skipping** (processing only every 5th frame) missing pedestrians
3. **CPU-only inference** reducing detection accuracy
4. **Insufficient debugging** making it hard to diagnose issues

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Lowered Confidence Thresholds
**File**: `/backend/services/detection_pipeline_service.py`

```python
# BEFORE
"pedestrian": {
    "min_confidence": 0.70,  # Too high!
    "nms_threshold": 0.45,
    "class_id": 0
},

# AFTER
"pedestrian": {
    "min_confidence": 0.35,  # Lowered from 0.70 to detect more pedestrians including children
    "nms_threshold": 0.45,
    "class_id": 0
},
```

### 2. Removed Frame Skipping
**Lines 735-738**: Commented out frame skipping to process every frame

```python
# BEFORE: Only processed every 5th frame
if frame_number % 5 != 0:
    continue

# AFTER: Process every frame
# if frame_number % 5 != 0:
#     continue
```

### 3. Enhanced YOLOv8 Inference Settings
**Line 210**: Lowered inference confidence threshold

```python
# Run inference with enhanced settings for better pedestrian detection
results = self.model(frame, verbose=False, conf=0.1)  # Lower inference confidence
```

### 4. Added Pedestrian-Specific Confidence Boosting
**New function**: `_enhance_pedestrian_detection()`

- Boosts confidence for smaller bounding boxes (children)
- Boosts confidence for typical human aspect ratios (1.5-4.0)
- Applies up to 0.05-0.08 confidence boost for qualifying detections

### 5. Enhanced Debugging and Logging
- Added detection confidence logging at debug level
- Added detection summary by class after processing
- Added warning when no valid detections found
- Added YOLO class mapping confirmation logs

### 6. Configuration Override Support
**Lines 734-738**: Allow runtime confidence threshold adjustment

```python
if config and 'confidence_threshold' in config:
    original_threshold = VRU_DETECTION_CONFIG["pedestrian"]["min_confidence"]
    VRU_DETECTION_CONFIG["pedestrian"]["min_confidence"] = config['confidence_threshold']
```

## Expected Results

With these fixes, the detection pipeline should now:

✅ **Detect children and adults** with confidence scores as low as 0.35  
✅ **Process every frame** instead of skipping 4/5 frames  
✅ **Apply confidence boosting** for child-sized pedestrians  
✅ **Provide detailed logging** for debugging detection issues  
✅ **Allow runtime configuration** via API parameters  

## Testing the Fixes

Run the test script to verify fixes:
```bash
cd /home/user/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/backend
python tests/test_pedestrian_detection_fix.py
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Processing time**: Will increase due to processing every frame
- **Memory usage**: May increase slightly due to more detections
- **Accuracy**: Should significantly improve for pedestrian detection

## API Usage

When calling the detection pipeline API, you can now override the confidence threshold:

```json
{
    "video_id": "your-video-id",
    "confidence_threshold": 0.25,
    "nms_threshold": 0.45,
    "target_classes": ["pedestrian"]
}
```
