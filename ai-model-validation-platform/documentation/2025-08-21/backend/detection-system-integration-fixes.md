- ✅ Improved error handling with actionable retry buttons
- ✅ Better cleanup of WebSocket connections
- ✅ Enhanced annotation clearing and state management

### 4. Environment Configuration (`src/utils/envConfig.ts`)

**Problems Fixed:**
- Proper WebSocket URL generation
- Backend server detection for production environment

**Solutions Applied:**
- ✅ Improved WebSocket URL generation from HTTP URLs
- ✅ Better environment detection for the production server at 155.138.239.131

### 5. New Testing Utilities

**Added Features:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive integration test utility (`src/utils/testDetectionIntegration.ts`)
- ✅ Backend connectivity testing
- ✅ Detection model availability checking
- ✅ WebSocket connection testing
- ✅ End-to-end detection service testing

## Key Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages instead of technical jargon
- Specific error categorization (network, timeout, server, validation)
- Progressive retry strategies with different configurations
- Clear visual feedback and recovery options

### Better WebSocket Integration
- Proper environment-based URL configuration
- Improved reconnection logic
- Better error handling and status reporting
- Automatic cleanup on component unmount

### Fallback Detection System
- Mock data generation when backend is unavailable
- Realistic detection annotations for demo purposes
- Clear indication of data source (Backend AI vs Demo Mode)

### Improved User Experience
- Visual status indicators with emojis
- Clear progress feedback during detection
- Actionable error messages with retry options
- Better loading states and progress indication

### Robust Configuration Management
- Environment-specific configuration
- Automatic server detection
- Proper URL generation for different services
- Comprehensive validation and error checking

## Backend Integration Points

The frontend now properly integrates with the backend at `155.138.239.131:8000`:

### API Endpoints Used:
- ✅ `GET /health` - Backend health check
- ✅ `GET /api/detection/models/available` - Available AI models
- ✅ `POST /api/detection/pipeline/run` - Run detection pipeline
- ✅ WebSocket `/ws/detection/{videoId}` - Real-time updates

### Detection Models:
The system now works with the available models:
- `yolov8n`, `yolov8s`, `yolov8m`, `yolov8l`, `yolov8x`
- `yolov9c`, `yolov9e`
- `yolov10n`, `yolov10s`

Default: `yolov8n`, Recommended: `yolov8s`

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Testing
1. **Backend Connectivity Test**
   - Health endpoint verification
   - Response time measurement
   - Error handling validation

2. **Detection Models Test**
   - Available models enumeration
   - Model configuration validation
   - Default and recommended model selection

3. **WebSocket Connection Test**
   - Connection establishment
   - Message handling
   - Reconnection behavior

4. **Detection Service Test**
   - End-to-end detection workflow
   - Fallback mechanism validation
   - Error recovery testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Detection Workflow:
- [ ] Upload a video file
- [ ] Open video details dialog
- [ ] Verify automatic detection starts
- [ ] Check detection results display
- [ ] Test retry mechanism on failure
- [ ] Verify fallback detection works
- [ ] Check WebSocket real-time updates

#### Error Handling:
- [ ] Test with network disconnected
- [ ] Test with invalid video files
- [ ] Test server timeout scenarios
- [ ] Verify error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Check retry button functionality

#### User Interface:
- [ ] Status indicators are clear
- [ ] Progress feedback is visible
- [ ] Error messages are actionable
- [ ] Loading states are appropriate

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The system automatically detects the backend server and configures:
- API URL: `http://155.138.239.131:8000`
- WebSocket URL: `ws://155.138.239.131:8000`
- Timeouts: 30s for detection, 20s for WebSocket
- Retry attempts: Progressive (2-3 retries with different configurations)

### Detection Configuration
Default detection parameters:
```typescript
{
  confidenceThreshold: 0.4,
  nmsThreshold: 0.5,
  modelName: 'yolov8s',
  targetClasses: ['person', 'bicycle', 'motorcycle', 'car', 'bus', 'truck'],
  maxRetries: 2,
  retryDelay: 1000,
  useFallback: true
}
```

## Deployment Notes

### Build Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ All imports and dependencies resolved
- ✅ Environment configuration validates successfully

### Production Readiness
- ✅ Error boundaries implemented
- ✅ Proper cleanup and memory management
- ✅ Responsive error handling
- ✅ User-friendly feedback systems

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Logging

- Error context collection
- Performance metrics tracking

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Real-time Progress Bars**: Show detection progress with WebSocket updates
2. **Model Selection UI**: Allow users to choose detection models
3. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple videos simultaneously
4. **Result Caching**: Cache detection results for faster re-access
5. **Advanced Retry Logic**: Machine learning-based retry strategies

### Performance Optimizations:
1. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse WebSocket connections
2. **Result Streaming**: Stream detection results as they're generated
3. **Lazy Loading**: Load detection results on demand
4. **Caching Layer**: Add detection result caching
