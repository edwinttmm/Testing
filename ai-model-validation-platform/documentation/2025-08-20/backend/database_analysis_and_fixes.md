# Database Analysis and Comprehensive Fix Plan

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Schema Consistency Issues**
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: `detection_events` table missing `event_type` column
  - **Root Cause**: Column defined in some migrations but not in the actual model
  - **Status**: Column doesn't exist in current schema, but model doesn't require it
  - **Decision**: No fix needed - the model works without this column

### 2. **Data Persistence Working Correctly**
- ✅ **WORKING**: Ground truth data insertion and persistence is functional
- ✅ **WORKING**: Database transactions are committing properly
- ✅ **WORKING**: Video upload and metadata storage works correctly

### 3. **Current Database State**
```
projects: 1 rows (✅ Contains default project)
videos: 1 rows (✅ Contains uploaded video)  
ground_truth_objects: 1 rows (✅ Successfully created test object)
detection_events: 0 rows (Expected - no test sessions created)
annotations: 0 rows (Expected - no manual annotations)
```

### 4. **Ground Truth Processing Analysis**
- ✅ **CRUD Operations**: `create_ground_truth_object()` function works correctly
- ✅ **Transaction Handling**: Database commits are successful
- ✅ **Schema Compatibility**: All required columns exist and are accessible

## Root Cause Analysis

The **primary issue** is not with database schema or persistence, but with the **ground truth processing workflow**:

1. **Video uploads successfully** ✅
2. **Database records created correctly** ✅ 
3. **Ground truth service starts processing** ✅
4. **ML model availability check fails** ❌ **ROOT CAUSE**

### The Real Problem: ML Dependencies

From the logs analysis and code review:

```python
# In GroundTruthService.__init__():
try:
    from ultralytics import YOLO
    import torch
    ML_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError as e:
    YOLO = None
    torch = None
    ML_AVAILABLE = False  # ← This is the issue!
```

**The ground truth processing fails because:**
1. ML dependencies (YOLOv8, torch) are not installed
2. Service falls back to disabled mode 
3. Processing stops with "ML not available" error
4. **24 detections were processed in memory but never saved** because ML unavailable flag prevented database storage

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Database Schema Verification ✅
All tables and columns exist correctly:
- `videos` table has `processing_status` and `ground_truth_generated` columns
- `ground_truth_objects` table has all required fields (x, y, width, height, confidence, etc.)
- Indexes are properly created for performance

### 2. Ground Truth Processing Fix

The service should **save detections even when ML is unavailable** for fallback scenarios.

### 3. Missing ML Dependencies Resolution

**Option A: Install ML Dependencies**
```bash
pip install torch ultralytics opencv-python
```

**Option B: Mock/Fallback Detection Service**
Create test detections when ML unavailable for development/testing.
