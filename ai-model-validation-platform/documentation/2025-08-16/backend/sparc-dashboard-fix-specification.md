# SPARC+TDD Dashboard Fix Specification

## ðŸŽ¯ **S**pecification Phase - Requirements Analysis

### Problem Analysis
**Primary Issues Identified:**
1. **Critical Runtime Error**: `handleError` function causing uncaught errors at `bundle.js:59359:58`
2. **Network Connection Failures**: API calls failing with "Network error - please check your connection"  
3. **Dummy Data Dependencies**: Dashboard showing placeholder data instead of real API responses
4. **Video Upload Failures**: Network errors preventing file uploads
5. **WebSocket Connection Timeouts**: Real-time server connections failing
6. **Non-Functional UI Components**: Navigation buttons and interactive elements not working
7. **Missing Backend Services**: API endpoints returning errors/404s

### Functional Requirements

#### R1: Error Handling & Recovery
- **R1.1**: Replace current `handleError` function with robust error boundary system
- **R1.2**: Implement graceful degradation for network failures
- **R1.3**: Add automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- **R1.4**: Create user-friendly error messages with actionable guidance

#### R2: API Integration & Data Flow
- **R2.1**: Establish reliable backend API connections
- **R2.2**: Replace all dummy/mock data with real API responses
- **R2.3**: Implement proper loading states and error handling for all endpoints
- **R2.4**: Add data validation and transformation layers

#### R3: Real-time Communication
- **R3.1**: Fix WebSocket connections for live metrics and updates
- **R3.2**: Implement connection recovery and heartbeat mechanisms
- **R3.3**: Add fallback polling for critical real-time features

#### R4: File Upload & Processing
- **R4.1**: Fix video upload functionality with progress tracking
- **R4.2**: Implement proper file validation and error handling
- **R4.3**: Add support for multiple file formats and sizes

#### R5: UI/UX Functionality
- **R5.1**: Fix all navigation and button interactions
- **R5.2**: Implement proper loading states across all components
- **R5.3**: Add accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- **R5.4**: Ensure responsive design across devices

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Page load time < 3 seconds
- API response time < 500ms for cached data
- Real-time updates with < 100ms latency
- File upload with progress feedback

#### Reliability
- 99.5% uptime for critical dashboard functions
- Graceful degradation during network issues
- Automatic error recovery where possible
- Comprehensive error logging and monitoring

#### Security
- Input validation on all forms
- Secure file upload with type/size restrictions
- XSS and CSRF protection
- Secure WebSocket connections

#### Scalability
- Support for concurrent users
- Efficient data caching strategies
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Optimized bundle sizes

### Technical Constraints
- **Frontend**: React 19.1.1 with TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI (MUI) v7.3.1
- **State Management**: React hooks with context
- **API Client**: Axios with interceptors
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Build Tool**: Create React App with Craco

### Success Criteria
1. **Zero Runtime Errors**: No uncaught exceptions in production
2. **100% API Connectivity**: All endpoints working with proper error handling
3. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket connections stable with < 5s reconnection
4. **File Operations**: Video uploads working with progress/status feedback
5. **User Experience**: All UI elements functional and accessible
6. **Test Coverage**: > 90% test coverage for critical components
7. **Performance**: Core Web Vitals in "Good" range (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms)

### Dependencies & Assumptions
- Backend API services are available or can be mocked appropriately
- Network infrastructure supports WebSocket connections
- File storage system is configured for uploads
- Error monitoring/logging infrastructure is in place

- **US5**: As a user, I want real-time updates of test execution metrics
- **US6**: As a manager, I want accurate reporting data for decision making

### Epic 3: File Management
- **US7**: As a user, I want to upload videos with progress feedback
- **US8**: As a user, I want to view and manage my uploaded files
- **US9**: As a system, I want to validate and process uploaded files securely

### Epic 4: System Reliability
- **US10**: As a user, I want the system to recover from network issues automatically
- **US11**: As a user, I want consistent performance across all dashboard pages
- **US12**: As an admin, I want monitoring and alerting for system issues
