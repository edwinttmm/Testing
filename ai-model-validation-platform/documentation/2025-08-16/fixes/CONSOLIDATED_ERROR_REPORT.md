## 2. Critical Bugs (Application Breaking)

*These issues prevent the application from running correctly or block core user workflows.*

### Finding C-01: Invalid Frontend Grid Component Prop

*   **Severity:** <font color="red">Critical</font>
*   **Location(s):**
    *   `/home/eddtmat/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/frontend/src/pages/Projects.tsx` (lines 284, 325)
    *   `/home/eddtmat/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetail.tsx` (lines 81, 98, 115, 132)
*   **Description:** The Material-UI `<Grid>` component is being used with an incorrect prop `size`. The correct prop to designate a grid item is `item`, with responsive sizing handled by breakpoint props (`xs`, `md`, `lg`). This bug breaks the page layout and will cause React to throw errors.
*   **Evidence:**
    ```typescriptreact
    // Incorrect usage in Projects.tsx
    <Grid size={{xs: 12, md: 6, lg: 4}} key={project.id}>
    ```
*   **Recommendation:** Replace `size` with the `item` prop and apply responsive props directly: `<Grid item xs={12} md={6} lg={4} ...>`.

### Finding C-02: Undefined Function Call in Backend

*   **Severity:** <font color="red">Critical</font>
*   **Location:** `/home/eddtmat/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/backend/main.py` (line 509)
*   **Description:** The `/api/detection-events` endpoint calls a function `get_socketio_manager()` which is neither defined nor imported in the file. This will cause the backend to crash with a `NameError` every time this endpoint is hit.
*   **Evidence:**
    ```python
    # This function does not exist
    socketio_manager = get_socketio_manager()
    await socketio_manager.emit_detection_event({...})
    ```
*   **Recommendation:** The likely intent was to use the globally available `sio` object. The call should be replaced with `await sio.emit(...)`.

### Finding C-03: Fatal Schema Mismatch (Frontend vs. Backend)

*   **Severity:** <font color="red">Critical</font>
*   **Location(s):**
    *   `frontend/src/pages/Projects.tsx` (form submission logic)
    *   `backend/main.py` (and inferred `schemas.py`)
*   **Description:** The frontend "Create Project" form sends a JSON payload with `camelCase` field names (e.g., `cameraModel`). The backend Pydantic models expect `snake_case` (e.g., `camera_model`) without any aliasing configuration. This mismatch will cause all project creation attempts to fail with a `422 Unprocessable Entity` error.
*   **Recommendation:** Update the backend Pydantic schemas to use `Field` aliases to correctly map the incoming `camelCase` JSON to the internal `snake_case` model attributes.

### Finding C-04: Conflicting Port & URL Configurations

*   **Severity:** <font color="red">Critical</font>
*   **Location(s):**
    *   `/home/eddtmat/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/frontend/.env`
    *   `/home/eddtmat/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/backend/main.py` (line 599)
    *   `/home/eddtmat/Testing/task-breakdown.md` (Section 1)
    *   `/home/eddtmat/Testing/tests/sparc-tdd-final-report.md`
*   **Description:** There is no consensus on which port the backend runs on, making frontend-to-backend communication impossible.
    *   `frontend/.env` and `backend/main.py` are configured to use port `8001`.
    *   The `task-breakdown.md` and `sparc-tdd-final-report.md` state the backend runs on port `8000` and instruct developers to configure the frontend for `8000`.
*   **Recommendation:** A single port must be chosen and enforced across all configurations. Standardize all files to use either `8000` or `8001`.

## 3. High-Severity Issues (Major Functionality & Security)

*These issues significantly impair features, introduce security risks, or represent major gaps in functionality.*

### Finding H-01: Unimplemented Stub Pages and Mocked Data

*   **Severity:** <font color="orange">High</font>
*   **Location(s):**
    *   `/home/eddtmat/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetail.tsx`
    *   `/home/eddtmat/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/backend/main.py` (lines 538-553)
*   **Description:** Core application pages are non-functional and display hardcoded mock data, giving a false impression of a working system.
    1.  The `ProjectDetail.tsx` page is entirely static and does not fetch any data based on the URL's project ID.
    2.  The backend's `/api/test-sessions/{session_id}/results` endpoint is completely mocked and always returns the same static data.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement the necessary backend endpoints and connect the frontend pages to fetch and display real, dynamic data.

### Finding H-02: Misleading Hardcoded Fallback Values

*   **Severity:** <font color="orange">High</font>
*   **Location:** `/home/eddtmat/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/backend/main.py` (lines 574, 584)
*   **Description:** The `/api/dashboard/stats` endpoint returns a hardcoded `averageAccuracy` of `94.2` when no real data is available. This is highly misleading as it reports excellent performance when the reality is a lack of data, potentially masking serious data pipeline issues.
*   **Evidence:**
    ```python
    # Returns 94.2 if avg_accuracy is 0
    "averageAccuracy": round(avg_accuracy * 100, 1) if avg_accuracy > 0 else 94.2,
    ```
*   **Recommendation:** The fallback value should be neutral and accurate, such as `0.0` or `null`, to correctly represent the absence of data.



### Finding H-04: Gaps in Remediation Plan

*   **Severity:** <font color="orange">High</font>
*   **Location:** `/home/eddtmat/Testing/task-breakdown.md`
*   **Description:** The `task-breakdown.md` file, while well-structured, completely omits several critical technical debt items identified in the TDD report, including Pydantic V2 migration, fixing CORS `OPTIONS` pre-flight requests, and configuring the frontend test environment.
*   **Recommendation:** Augment the `task-breakdown.md` with new sections to explicitly track and address this technical debt.

### Finding M-02: Unsafe Type Assertion in Form Handler

*   **Severity:** <font color="orange">Medium</font>
*   **Location:** `/home/eddtmat/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/frontend/src/pages/Projects.tsx` (line 498)
*   **Description:** The `onChange` handler for the `Select` component uses an unsafe `e.target.value as any` type assertion. This completely bypasses TypeScript's type safety and can hide potential bugs.
*   **Evidence:**
    ```typescriptreact
    onChange={(e) => handleFormChange('cameraView', e.target.value as any)}
    ```
*   **Recommendation:** Import and use the `SelectChangeEvent` type from `@mui/material` to provide full type safety for the event handler.

### Finding M-03: Conflicting Port Information in Documentation

*   **Severity:** <font color="orange">Medium</font>
*   **Location(s):**
    *   `/home/eddtmat/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/frontend/README.md`
    *   `/home/eddtmat/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/frontend/.env`
*   **Description:** The frontend `README.md` instructs developers to access the app on port `3000`, but the `.env` file explicitly configures it to run on port `3001`. This is a documentation bug that will confuse new developers.
*   **Recommendation:** Update the `README.md` to reflect the correct port (`3001`) defined in the environment configuration.

## 5. Low-Severity Issues (Documentation & Minor Polish)

*These are minor issues, such as typos or incomplete documentation, that should be fixed for quality and clarity.*

### Finding L-01: Incomplete SPARC Command Documentation

*   **Severity:** <font color="yellow">Low</font>
*   **Location(s):**
    *   `/home/eddtmat/Testing/.claude/commands/sparc.md`
    *   `/home/eddtmat/Testing/.claude/commands/sparc/sparc.md`
*   **Description:** The main `sparc.md` command documentation is incomplete. It only lists `spec-pseudocode` as a delegatable task, while the orchestrator's own instructions in `sparc/sparc.md` list many more.
*   **Recommendation:** Update the main `sparc.md` file to include the full list of delegatable tasks to provide a complete and accurate overview.

### Finding L-02: Typo in Orchestrator Instructions

*   **Severity:** <font color="yellow">Low</font>
*   **Location:** `/home/eddtmat/Testing/.claude/commands/sparc/sparc.md` (line 25)
*   **Description:** The instructions for the `sparc-sparc` agent contain a minor typo.
*   **Evidence:**
    ```markdown
    ...a brief welcome mesage.
    ```
*   **Recommendation:** Correct "mesage" to "message".

### Finding L-03: Incomplete Edit/Delete Functionality

*   **Severity:** <font color="yellow">Low</font>
*   **Location:** `/home/eddtmat/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/frontend/src/pages/Projects.tsx` (lines 410-416)
*   **Description:** The "Edit" and "Delete" menu items on the project cards are non-functional placeholders. Clicking them closes the menu but performs no action.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement the `handleEdit` and `handleDelete` functions and connect them to the `MenuItem` `onClick` events to provide full CRUD functionality.
