### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Video Upload → Annotation → Playback Workflow
- [ ] Project creation and selection
- [ ] Video upload and processing
- [ ] Video playback with controls
- [ ] Annotation creation and editing
- [ ] Real-time test session execution
- [ ] Error handling and recovery

#### Accessibility Testing
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (Tab, Space, Arrow keys)
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Focus management and visual indicators
- [ ] ARIA labels and descriptions

#### Cross-Environment Compatibility
- [ ] Localhost development (http://localhost:3000)
- [ ] Production server (http://155.138.239.131:3000)
- [ ] WebSocket connections in both environments
- [ ] Video streaming and playback

#### Performance Testing
- [ ] Large video file handling (>100MB)
- [ ] Multiple simultaneous video streams
- [ ] Memory usage during extended playback
- [ ] Network resilience and retry logic

## 🔍 Monitoring and Debugging

### Development Debug Features
- Environment configuration logging
- Video playback state monitoring  
- WebSocket connection status
- Performance metrics collection

### Error Recovery Mechanisms
- **Video Playback**: Auto-retry with exponential backoff
- **WebSocket**: Reconnection with configurable attempts
- **API Calls**: Timeout and retry handling
- **Network Issues**: Graceful degradation

### Performance Optimizations
- **Video Loading**: Lazy loading and progressive enhancement
- **Canvas Rendering**: Efficient annotation drawing
- **State Management**: Optimized re-renders
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and disposal

## 🚨 Known Limitations and Considerations

### Browser Compatibility
- Requires modern browsers with ES2020 support
- WebSocket support required for real-time features
- HTML5 video element support required

### Network Requirements
- Stable internet connection for video streaming
- WebSocket support (fallback to polling available)
- Adequate bandwidth for video content

### Performance Considerations
- Large video files may require significant memory
- Canvas annotations scale with video resolution
- Real-time features depend on network latency

## 📋 Post-Deployment Verification

### Health Checks
1. **API Connectivity**: Verify all endpoints respond correctly
2. **WebSocket Connection**: Confirm real-time features work
3. **Video Streaming**: Test video playback across different formats
4. **Annotation System**: Verify canvas rendering and interactions
5. **Error Handling**: Test recovery from common failure scenarios

### Performance Monitoring
1. **Page Load Times**: Monitor initial application loading
2. **Video Loading**: Track time to first frame
3. **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks during extended use
4. **Network Traffic**: Optimize video streaming efficiency

### User Experience Validation
1. **Accessibility**: Test with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Verify functionality on mobile devices
3. **Cross-Browser**: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
4. **Error Messages**: Ensure user-friendly error communication
