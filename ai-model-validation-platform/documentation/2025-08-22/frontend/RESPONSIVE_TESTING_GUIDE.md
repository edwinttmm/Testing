## Responsive Breakpoint Testing

### Using Browser DevTools
1. **Chrome DevTools**:
   ```
   F12 → Toggle device toolbar → Select "Responsive"
   Test these specific widths: 320px, 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
   ```

2. **Firefox DevTools**:
   ```
   F12 → Responsive Design Mode → Test preset devices
   iPhone SE, iPad, Desktop HD
   ```

3. **Safari DevTools**:
   ```
   Develop → Responsive Design Mode
   Test iPhone 13, iPad Pro, MacBook Pro
   ```

## Manual Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Video Playback on Mobile
```
Steps:
1. Open test execution page on mobile device (< 600px width)
2. Select a project with uploaded videos
3. Start a test session
4. Verify video player loads with mobile-optimized controls
5. Test play/pause with touch
6. Test seeking by dragging slider
7. Test volume control
8. Rotate device and verify landscape adaptation

Expected Results:
- Controls are easily touchable (minimum 44px height)
- Video scales appropriately to screen
- No horizontal scrolling required
- Touch interactions feel responsive
```

### Scenario 2: Detection Controls Responsiveness
```
Steps:
1. Navigate to a project with detection capabilities
2. Start a detection session
3. Verify start/stop detection buttons on different screen sizes
4. Test screenshot capture functionality
5. Check annotation display and interaction

Expected Results:
- Detection buttons maintain accessibility standards
- Status indicators are clearly visible
- Touch feedback is immediate
- Screenshot gallery scrolls smoothly
```

### Scenario 3: Annotation Management
```
Steps:
1. Open video with existing annotations
2. Test annotation selection on different devices
3. Verify annotation creation in annotation mode
4. Test annotation display in detection gallery

Expected Results:
- Annotations are easily selectable on touch devices
- Visual indicators are appropriately sized
- Annotation details are readable on small screens
- Touch interactions don't interfere with video controls
```

## Automated Testing Commands

### Run Responsive Tests
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd /home/user/Testing/ai-model-validation-platform/frontend

# Run responsive component tests
npm test -- --testNamePattern="Responsive Video Player"

# Run all frontend tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false

# Run specific test file
npm test src/tests/responsive-video-player.test.tsx
```

### Visual Regression Testing
```bash
# If using Storybook (optional)
npm run storybook

# Generate visual snapshots
npm run test:visual

# Compare with baseline
npm run test:visual:compare
```

## Performance Testing

### Core Web Vitals on Mobile
```javascript
// Test in browser console
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    console.log(entry.name, entry.value);
  }
});

observer.observe({entryTypes: ['largest-contentful-paint', 'first-input', 'layout-shift']});
```

### Memory Usage Testing
```javascript
// Monitor memory usage
console.log(performance.memory);

// Test video memory cleanup
// 1. Load video
// 2. Play for 30 seconds
// 3. Pause and check memory
// 4. Navigate away and return
// 5. Verify no memory leaks
```

## Accessibility Testing

### Screen Reader Testing
```bash
# Test with screen reader software:
# - NVDA (Windows)
# - VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)
# - TalkBack (Android)

Key verification points:
- All controls have appropriate ARIA labels
- Video progress is announced correctly
- Detection status changes are announced
- Annotations are properly described
```

### Keyboard Navigation Testing
```
Tab order should follow logical flow:
1. Video container (space to play/pause)
2. Progress slider (arrow keys to seek)
3. Play/pause button
4. Volume controls
5. Playback rate (if visible)
6. Fullscreen button
7. Detection controls
8. Annotation items (if present)

Keyboard shortcuts:
- Space: Play/pause
- Left/Right arrows: Seek ±10 seconds
- Up/Down arrows: Volume ±10%
- M: Toggle mute
- F: Toggle fullscreen
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Touch Targets Too Small
```css
/* Ensure minimum 44px touch targets */
.MuiButton-root {
  min-height: 44px;
  min-width: 44px;
}

.MuiIconButton-root {
  min-height: 48px;
  min-width: 48px;
}
```

### Issue 2: Video Not Responsive
```css
/* Ensure proper video scaling */
video {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  max-height: 70vh;
  object-fit: contain;
}
```

### Issue 3: Controls Overlapping on Small Screens
```css
/* Use proper responsive spacing */
.video-controls {
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 8px;
}

@media (max-width: 599px) {
  .video-controls {
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: stretch;
  }
}
```

### Issue 4: Annotations Hard to Select on Touch
```css
/* Increase touch area for annotations */
.annotation-chip {
  min-height: 36px;
  padding: 8px 12px;
  touch-action: manipulation;
}
```
