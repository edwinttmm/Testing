# ADR-001: Annotation Management System Architecture

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The AI Model Validation Platform requires a comprehensive annotation management system to handle temporal video annotations, collaborative editing, and validation workflows. The current system lacks structured annotation capabilities, making it difficult to create ground truth data and validate model performance effectively.

## Decision
Implement a three-tier annotation management system with:
1. **Temporal annotation support** with keyframe-based data structure
2. **Collaborative real-time editing** via WebSocket integration
3. **Multi-format export capabilities** (COCO, YOLO, custom JSON)

### Key Components:
- `annotation_sessions` table for managing annotation workflows
- `video_annotations` table for temporal annotation data
- `annotation_keyframes` table for frame-specific annotation details
- `AnnotationManagementService` for business logic orchestration
- Real-time collaboration via enhanced WebSocket architecture

## Consequences

### Positive:
- **Structured annotation workflow** enabling efficient ground truth creation
- **Real-time collaboration** allowing multiple annotators to work simultaneously
- **Flexible export formats** supporting various ML training frameworks
- **Temporal awareness** enabling time-based validation scenarios
- **Scalable architecture** supporting high annotation volumes

### Negative:
- **Increased database complexity** with additional tables and relationships
- **Storage overhead** for keyframe data and temporal information
- **WebSocket scaling challenges** for large numbers of concurrent annotators
- **Complex validation logic** for ensuring annotation consistency

### Risks:
- **Performance impact** from real-time synchronization overhead
- **Data consistency issues** in collaborative editing scenarios
- **Storage growth** from detailed keyframe annotations

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. File-based Annotation Storage
**Rejected** - Would not provide real-time collaboration capabilities and would be difficult to query efficiently.

### 2. Third-party Annotation Tools Integration
**Rejected** - Would introduce external dependencies and limit customization for VRU-specific workflows.

### 3. Simplified Single-table Approach
**Rejected** - Would not provide sufficient granularity for temporal annotations and keyframe management.

## Implementation Notes
- Use composite indexes on `(annotation_session_id, start_timestamp)` for efficient temporal queries
- Implement optimistic locking for collaborative editing conflict resolution
- Consider partitioning annotation tables by project for large-scale deployments
- Use Redis for caching frequently accessed annotation sessions
