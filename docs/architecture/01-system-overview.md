# VRU Detection System - System Overview (C4 Level 1)

## Executive Summary

The VRU (Vulnerable Road User) Detection System is a comprehensive platform for validating computer vision models used in automotive safety systems. The system processes video streams from vehicle cameras, detects VRUs (pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists), and validates detection accuracy against ground truth data with precise timing requirements.
